# How to use

## Disclaimer

> Toucan product is currently in its beta phase, which means you might encounter issues when attempting to customize the template with Toucan. While we‚Äôre actively refining and improving the experience, some features may be unstable or require manual adjustments. The T-Doc template is fully operational as it is! We appreciate your flexibility as we work towards a more polished version! üöÄ

## Introduction

Thank you for purchasing T-Doc Template! This template is built on our very own, soaring Toucan static site generator, which uses Markdown for content creation and Mustache templates for layout and design. Together, these tools make it easy to add, edit, and manage your site‚Äôs content while maintaining a visually appealing and professional design. Mustache templates can be used not only for design but also for dynamic components.

With Markdown, you can write formatted text in plain-text files, which Toucan converts into HTML. Mustache templates allow you to customize the layout and presentation of your site with clean, readable syntax. Together, they give you full control over both the content and appearance of your site.

This guide will walk you through essential tasks, such as changing the site logo, adding new content (categories, guides), and customizing your site‚Äôs pages and footer. It also covers Markdown basics and provides instructions for deploying your site to GitHub Pages, ensuring a smooth publishing process.
