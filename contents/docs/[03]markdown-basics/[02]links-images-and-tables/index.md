# Links, Images, and Tables

Markdown provides a simple syntax for adding links, images, and tables to your documents.

---

## Links

### Basic Links

Use square brackets `[ ]` for the link text and parentheses `( )` to enclose the URL:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

---

### Links with Titles

Add a title by including text in quotes after the URL:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com "Optional Title")
```

---

## Images

### Basic Images

Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` at the beginning:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

The image URL can be relative or absolute.

---

### Images with Titles

Add a title in quotes for extra context:

```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg "Optional Title")
```

---

### Tables

Use pipes `|` and dashes `-` to create tables:

```
| Syntax   | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Bold** | Bold text   |
| _Italic_ | Italic text |
```

---

### Code Blocks

## Inline Codes

Wrap code in backticks:

```
`inline code`
```

---

## Multi-line Codes

Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to format multi-line code blocks:

```
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
}
```

---

### Wrapping Up

Markdown provides a simple way to include links, images, tables, and code in your content. Master these features to create well-structured and visually appealing documents!
